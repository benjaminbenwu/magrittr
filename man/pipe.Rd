\description{
The \code{\%>\%} operator pipes the left-hand side into an
expression on the right-hand side. The expression can
contain a \code{.} as placeholder to indicate the position
taken by the object in the pipeline. If not present, it
will be squeezed in as the first argument. If the
right-hand side expression is a function call that takes
only one argument, one can omit parentheses and the
\code{.}. Only the outmost call is matched against the dot,
which means that e.g. formulas can still use a dot which
will not be matched. Nested functions will not be matched
either.
